    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>About Student Assignment Submission Portal</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">A Student assignment Submission(SAS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information 
	system for education establishments to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading,transcripts,
	results of student tests and other assessment scores; building student schedules; tracking student attendance; and managing  many other student-related data needs in a school.A SIS 
	should not be confused with a learning management system or virtual learning environment, where course materials, assignments and assessment tests can be published electronically.The SIS can include features that can be considered as an enterprise resource planning or ERP system for a corporate customer.
	As  such, many of the  ERP system selection methodology,implementation, and operation of an ERP system apply too.</p>
